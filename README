Provide xml sitemap and html helpers

First, make a Sitemap page at the top level of the cms (so these work)

you can now hit $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']/sitemap.xml and you'll get a sitemap

if you want to make a html version there is a built in helper:

<?=partial("__sitemap", array('filters'=>$filters, "scope"=>$cms_live_scope, 'nodes'=>false, 'change'=>"monthly", 'model'=> new $cms_content_class))?>

$filters are applied to the model and children calls and should be in this form:

$filters = array(
              array('col'=>"column name", 'val'=>"value", 'operator'=> "= / != etc");
              );
              
$scope is a model scope ("live" etc)
